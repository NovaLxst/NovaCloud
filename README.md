Why is it getting flagged?
Many executors modify memory or execute scripts dynamically, which antivirus (AV) and anti-cheat systems detect as suspicious behavior.
Heuristic analysis flags executables that behave similarly to malware, even if they aren’t harmful.
f your executor injects code into other processes (e.g., a game client), security systems may flag it as a cheat or malware.
Memory scanning tools detect and block unauthorized modifications.
